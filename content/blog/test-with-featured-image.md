aasdasdHello world! this post is just for testing.

*is this word italic?*

**is this bold?**

## ow, here's some code:

`function test(){`

`var str = "This is a String"`

`var num = 123`

`if(num < 100){`\
`asdasd`

`console.log("IT'S LESS!")`

`}else{`

`console.log("IT'S MORE!")`

`}`

`const arr = [1,2,3,"a"]`

`for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){`

``console.log(`${str} ${arr[i]}`)``

`}`

`}`
